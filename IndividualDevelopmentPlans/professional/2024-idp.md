# 2024 IDP - Roderick Bishop


## Goals & expectations

In the context of my entire career, I seek to become an interdisciplinary engineer with the ability to write code, deploy systems, and develop or integrate hardware with general aptitude across these domains. This aspiration led me to this team as a choice, as it is one of the few teams at Target that gives exposure to all of these areas.

## Looking Back to 2023

2023 was my first full-time year as an SWE. Very enlightening. I truly learned a lot and in the way of the Dunning–Kruger effect, I've learned that there is so much still to master! An exciting journey lies ahead.

From 2023's IDP:
>While on the IOT team, specifically on the Shared Services pod I am focused on learning and gaining proficiency in the areas of Backend programming, Databases & data science, devOps, security, & wireless communication. In my short time on this team I have been able to choose work that gives exposure and experience in these areas. Along with these hard skills, I aspire to continue to network & develop soft skills necessary to excel at leadership roles.
>

Of those goals, I've completed work in the following areas, represented as completion to personal satisfaction.

- **Backend Programming:**  ![backend_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/60)
  - Took responsibility for 2 applications, 1 deprecated & the other still in development
  - Learned more about what's going on under the hood with Gradle as a build tool as well as Kotlin as a language. Topics like project & task configuration, dependency management,  
  - Error Flow conventions
  - Observability and metics
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Using CLI's & other tools

While my learning in this area was substantial, my delivery was not. Mid-year project deprecation was a team choice and my second application not being delivered by Q4 is not necessarily a negative but should not be counted as a positive agains this goal.

- **Security:**  ![security_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/15)
  - Completed work relating to request authentication; tokens, goProxy, enterprise secret practices etc.
  - Completed some work around remediating security vulnerabilites and the tooling to help with that.

- **Data Science:**  ![data_science_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
- No progress on this stated goal.

Over the course of the year however, I have been able to deliver work for the team that required learning in a few areas with great satisfaction. The following I consider my **Experiential Learning Wins**:

- Unit Testing: ![unit_testing_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
  - Using Kotlin's Kotest & Micronaut as tools, I learned to test kotlin native applications as well as open source external app libraries. General exposure to testing units across API components was garnered as well. Testing controllers by using a test client that makes the request to the controller, validating payloads, responses and service calls were great experiences. I learned about testing services as well as testing extensions/components that aren't classes for functionality.
  - Mocks, Stubs, & Spy's using Mockk & Mockito to isolate units and behaviors we want to test.

- Data-Driven Testing (DDT): ![data_driven_testing_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/80)
  - data driven tests
  - dynamic mocking for DDT involving tables and index vars
  - test scopes & test runtimes

- Application Design ![app_progress](https://geps.dev/progress/40)
  - With both Lockjaw (Agent-proxy) and Benatar (Camunda Cockpit server app) I got to do app design work. I definitely understand now how important this phase of the SDLC is. There is still so much to learn here for me in this area but the experience that I did gain will help streamline the process of design as well as development in the future.

## What I'm working on now in 2024

This year, I'd like to carry over my learning intent in security, backend programming in terms of writing code or deploying systems with scalability in mind. Inspired by last year's bonus experiential learning I have intents to focus story work and learning around:

- Application Security
- Deployment & DevOps
- Horizontal Scaling of systems and apps
- Databases & Data Access
- App Integration and Testing
- *Networks - learning Topic*
- *App Compile & Runtime - learning topic*

As an individual contributor, I'd like to simply write as much code as possible. Last year was integral to developing the capacity & capability necessary to deliver more for the team. I plan to continue to scale over last year's deliverabiles, kicking off the year with the implementation of Lockjaw which was started last year. With the recent work on realigning our team to OKR's as well, it's easier for me to see where I can help the team after this initial accomplishment. I have observed substantial changes in speed & correctness of code delivery from my end especially with respect to testing, a refinement of approach and process with new applications, and greater knowledge of or influence over RFID applications as the year progressed.
