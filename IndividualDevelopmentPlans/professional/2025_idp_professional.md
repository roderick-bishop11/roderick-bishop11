# 2025 IDP - Roderick Bishop

## Goals & expectations

In the context of my entire career, I seek to become an interdisciplinary engineer with the ability to write code, deploy systems, and develop or integrate hardware with general aptitude across these domains. This aspiration led me to this team as a choice, as it is one of the few teams at Target that gives exposure to all of these areas.

- ## What I'm working on now in 2025

This year, I'd like to carry over my learning intent in <list> . Inspired by last year's bonus experiential learning I have intents to focus story work and learning around:

- list item 

- <mark>As an individual contributor, I'd like to simply write as much code as possible. Last year was integral to developing the capacity & capability necessary to deliver more for the team. I plan to continue to scale over last year's deliverabiles, kicking off the year with the implementation of Lockjaw which was started last year. With the recent work on realigning our team to OKR's as well, it's easier for me to see where I can help the team after this initial accomplishment. I have observed substantial changes in speed & correctness of code delivery from my end especially with respect to testing, a refinement of approach and process with new applications, and greater knowledge of or influence over RFID applications as the year progressed.
