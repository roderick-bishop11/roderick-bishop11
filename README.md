Hi I'm Roderick. A SWE currently working on IoT applications at Target. I find joy in learning more and more about software; how to write it, how to test it, how to deploy and employ it for the greater good of myself and those around me.

## Currently Learning

- Python & using it to build apps that use LLMs
- Adruino

## A few things I've read recently that I want to share

- [MemGPT]: A Step Towards LLMs as Operating Systems
  - [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08560.pdf)
  - [github](https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT/tree/main)
